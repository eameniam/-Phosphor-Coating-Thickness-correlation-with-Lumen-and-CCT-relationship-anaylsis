## Introduction
In this report, we want to determine whether the new developed low profile WLED packaging method could maintain a better lumen performance compared with conventional WLED. In the experiment, the lumen performance of the low profile and conventional LED were characterized base on the changing of color temperature.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
In order to determine the influence of new packaging method, several consideration should be taken into concern, which will be very helpful for the data analysis.
In this project, I use my experiment data of WLED samples with conventional packaging and new develped low profile packaging

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is a notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.
Below are my steps for making conclusion based on the data analysis of factors affecting the comparison result:

### 1.Data Preparation
·remove the irrelevant information
·reformat the information and imputing missing values

### 2.Data Modeling
·Using machine learning for further analysis
·Applying Simple Linear Regression to predict the lumen performance trending

### 3.Result and Conclusion
·Finding out whether there is an improvement on the low profile packaged WLED

## Results<a name="results"></a>
The main results will be discussed in the pulished paper

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
All the experiment result are based on my experiment.
