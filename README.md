## Introduction
In this report, we want to determine whether the new developed low profile WLED packaging method could maintain a better lumen performance compared with conventional WLED. In the experiment, the lumen performance of the low profile and conventional LED were characterized base on the changing of color temperature.

## Insights
In order to determine the influence of new packaging method, several consideration should be taken into concern, which will be very helpful for the data analysis.

## Approach and Methods
In this project, I use my experiment data of WLED samples with conventional packaging and new develped low profile packaging
Below are my steps for making conclusion based on the data analysis of factors affecting the comparison result:

### 1.Data Preparation
·remove the irrelevant information
·reformat the information and imputing missing values

### 2.Data Modeling
·Using machine learning for further analysis
·Applying Simple Linear Regression to predict the lumen performance trending

### 3.Result and Conclusion
·Finding out whether there is an improvement on the low profile packaged WLED
